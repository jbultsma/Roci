# Codename-Rocinante
A C# .NET CORE Web application using MVC, a SQL Database, and multiple API's for our Final Projects

This repo is a group effort from Moise Ingabire, Maricela Rivera, and Joshua Bultsma. 
It is the effort for our final capstone project for the end of our C#/.NET After Hours Bootcamp at Grand Circus.

We are very proud of the work we have done so far in this bootcamp and are increbily exited to share the work
we do on this final capstone. 

We are doing our best to have this project represent the skills we have learned thus far and hope it can display our 
abilites to compete in the job market as a software developer. We hope you agree and we are very eager to share the final
build with you!

Cheers!

Team Rocinante
